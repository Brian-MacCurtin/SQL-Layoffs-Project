# Project Overview
This project took a look at layoff numbers from companies world-wide during the COVID pandemic. The dataset provided many descriptive columns regarding each company, as well as some numerical variables regarding the layoffs they had.

# Project Motivation
The original dataset had many issues with it, so this project was designed to learn how to utilize SQL to clean the dataset, and then how to perform EDA on the dataset. This project also gave me hands-on experience working with MySQL and MySQLWorkbench

## Tools I Used
- SQL → Language used to query the database
- MySQL → Database used to store data
- MySQLWorkbench → Platform used to write SQL queries
- Git/Github → Tracks code updates and used for presentation
- Markdown → Used to write this report

## SQL Techniques I Worked On
- Creating/updating tables
- Strings
- Operators and Aggregation
- Joins
- Subqueries and CTEs

## SQL Techniques I Learned
- Optimal data cleaning practices including:
    - Making edits on a staging dataset
    - Removing duplicates
    - Data standardization
    - Dealing with nulls
- Window Functions
- Stored Procedures and Parameters
- Triggers and Events
